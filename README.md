# squidpy-utils
a collection of utilities to support analysis with [squidpy](https://github.com/theislab/squidpy).

# installation
Create an environment for working on your squidpy projects. If you are using anaconda, you can enter the following in your terminal:

conda create -n squidpy python=3.8
```

Activate your newly created squidpy environment. For anaconda you can enter:

```bash
conda activate squidpy
```

Navigate to the directory you would like to download the squidpy-utils to. For example, if you want to clone the repository to your Documents folder, you would enter:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
```

Clone the squidpy-utils repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinyamauchi/squidpy-utils.git
```

Navigate to the squidpy-utils directory

```bash
cd squidpy-utils
```

Install `squidpy-utiils`. If you would like to be able to add/edit functionality, install in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Otherwise, perform a standard installation:

```bash
pip install .
```
